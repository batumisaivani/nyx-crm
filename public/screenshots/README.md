## How to Add Screenshots

1. Take screenshots of your app and CRM (different screens)
2. Name them sequentially starting from 1:
   - Mobile: `mobile-app-1.png`, `mobile-app-2.png`, etc.
   - Desktop: `crm-desktop-1.png`, `crm-desktop-2.png`, etc.
3. Place them in this folder: `/public/screenshots/`
4. The landing page will automatically detect and display them in a rotating carousel
